This project is a React-based web application built with TypeScript and Material-UI. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, featuring a responsive UI, custom hooks, and a theme system for consistent styling.

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

- Pre-built, accessible Material-UI components
- Responsive design patterns
- Customizable card variants
- Navigation components (Breadcrumb, TabBar)
- Modal and dialog systems

### ðŸ›  Development Tools

- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and enhanced IDE integration
- **Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic for common patterns
- **State Management** - Integrated Zustand store
- **Utility Functions** - Common helpers for URLs, storage, and more

### ðŸŽ¯ Architecture

- **Modular Design** - Independent, composable components
- **Scalable Structure** - Organized for large applications
- **Theme System** - Customizable design tokens
- **Provider System** - Context-based configuration

### Creating and Using the Package

This guide explains how to create a .tgz package from this project and use it in other projects.

#### Package Structure

The project exports various components and utilities through its main entry point:

```typescript:src/index.ts
export * from "./components";
export * from "./theme";
export * from "./functions";
export * from "./hooks";
export * from "./patterns";
export * from "./store";
export * from "./provider";
export * from "./logical_components";
```

#### Creating the Package

<!-- change version number -->

Update package.json

```json:package.json
{
  "version": "x.x.x"
}
```

To create a .tgz package, run the following command:

```bash
npm run pack
```

#### Using the Package

To use the package in another project, install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install path/to/the/design_system-x.x.x.tgz
# or
yarn add path/to/the/design_system-x.x.x.tgz
```

#### Importing Components

After installing the package, you can import and use the components like this:

```typescript
import { BreadCrumb } from "design_system";
```
